# Customer Churn Analysis | Power BI • Python
## Project Overview
#### Customer churn poses a significant challenge in the telecom industry, with direct implications for revenue and customer retention. This project examines customer churn data to uncover the key factors driving churn and deliver actionable business insights through Power BI and Python.


## Objectives
#### Examine customer churn patterns and uncover the primary factors contributing to customer attrition. Identify at-risk customers with a machine learning model to predict churn. The findings are designed to support data-driven retention strategies while delivering clear, actionable KPIs for business


##  Tools Used
- #### **Python** – Data cleaning and preprocessing, KPI calculations, EDA, machine learning model developed and churn analysis
- #### **Power BI** – Data modeling and dashboard visualization


## Workflow
1. ### Data Cleaning & preprocessing (Python)
* Fixed inconsistencies and formatting.
* Handled missing values and duplicates
* Data segmentation

2. ### Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
Calculated:
* Total Customers
* Overall Churn Rate
* Churned Customers
* Analyze several distributions

![Overall churn rate.](/1_churn_rate.png "Customer churn rate.")
![Churn rate by tenure.](/2_churn_tenure.png "Churn rate by tenure.")
![Churn rate by contract type.](/3_churn_contract_type.png "Churn rate by contract type.")
![Churn rate by payment method.](/4_churn_payment_method.png "Churn rate by payment method.")

3. ### Churn Prediction Model (Python)
* Develop a churn prediction model using several machine learning algorithms 
* Evaluate the model's performance

![Churn prediction model.](/6_ml_2.png "Machine learning model performance part 2.")

4. ### Dashboard (Power BI)
* Calculated new measures
* Created interactive visuals
* Designed structured churn insights

##  Key Insights
* Month-to-month contracts have highest churn
* Low tenure customers churn most
* Payment methods influence churn



## Business Value
#### The performed data analysis enables the company to:
* #### Predict high-risk customers.
* #### Optimize retention efforts.
* #### Mitigate revenue loss.
* #### Make data-backed strategic decisions.
